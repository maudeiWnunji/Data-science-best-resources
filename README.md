# Torrentio Addon
  
This application is continually updated with new features and fixes. The newest version of Stremio is V1.6.9 which was released on April 3, 2024. Some important updates in this latest release include:
 
In this tutorial, we will show you how to register for a free Stremio account as well as a step-by-step installation guide. We are using a Fire TV Stick 4K Max which is the most popular streaming device.

These steps also work for any variation of Firestick and Fire TV as well as Android TV/Google TV Boxes. For those who prefer other options, this app is also supported on Windows, Linux, Mac, Android phones/tablets, and via a web browser.
 
If you have a real-debrid subscription, we can integrate this into Torrentio for premium HD streaming links. Torrentio also accepts other resolving services including AllDebrid, Offcloud, Debrid-Link, Premiumize, and more.
 
It syncs perfectly with popular streaming apps such as Stremio, Kodi, Netflix, Plex, Emby, VLC, and more. Trakt will ensure you never lose your favorite flicks and shows and can always continue watching no matter where you are or what service you are using.
 
There are a few choices available, however, the most popular is the streaming catalogs which aggregates some of the most popular streaming apps and platforms to integrate within the Stremio application.
 
Yes. Stremio is 100% legal to install and use. However, some content provided may be illegal. To ensure you are not illegally streaming, make sure to only watch Movies and TV Shows in the public domain.
 
I appreciate the answers - I have tried to follow everything in the message. However when I try to add torrentio - nothing happens. First Malwarebytes blocked it - I disabled it. After that - still nothing. I got the list- entered RD and the API key - clicked INSTALL - absolutely nothing?!?!?!?!

I FINALLY got it work - uninstalled everything. Installed from Stremio. Had to use browser from ONN to install torrentio add-on. It now shows as installed!!
Now I just hope the app is worth it.
Thanks everyone
 
I have been active in streaming culture for so very long. For some reason, I just never felt like investing the time in Steamio. I decided, since the Troypoint video was so well laid out, to give it a whirl.
I have to say, the content and the quality of the streams is amazing. So very happy I gave it a try. I have a few movies I use to verify a streaming source and this passed with flying colors.
Very happy I checked it out and Thank You for posting the tutorial.
 
Followed the steps, got it running and now i can watch Dawn of the Living Dead. Literally nothing else streams.
And sincerely, thanks for taking the time to put out the video. I would never been able to at least try it without it.
Keep up the good work!

Hi, I have been installing Kodi along with APK with no problems. I installed Stremio but cannot figure out how to download streams.
I have tried installing them in the app to no avail. Where do I go to download the add-ons?
 
Well Kodi and Stremio are equally as good for Movies and Series. Those are my top 2, although I no longer use Kodi. Kodi, if configured properly, and you integrate Real Debrid, is every bit as good as Stremio and vise versa.
 
Considering these add ons have no bearing or take up any space on your device, just add anything or everything you want that is in a language you understand. That would be a lot of add ons to install and it will take at least 15 minutes
 
Hello, I watched the installation, it was very helpful, thank you.
The app was working well until I added real Debrid. I am sure I did everything correctly, Torrentio is showing RD after the name but now when choosing a movie it says No Streams Found. I re installed and same issue. Thanks in advance for any help.
 
I did indeed watch the tutorial, it was very helpful. Before I installed RD everything worked, I was able to stream movie titles. After installing RD everything says no streams found. Not sure what ive done wrong.
 
Check that you have installed Torrentio correctly. If you find that you have not done so, do not try to amend the existing Torrentio settings you have, otherwise you will end up with two versions that will conflict with each other.
 
Miki I have tried and tried creating an account and Everytime I try to log in it wants me to reset my password. I done this 4 times and it continues. I deleted first account and it still does it. HELP
 
How to use Realdebrid with Stremio? I have set up Stremio on my computer with Rd. I have two onn boxes with Stremio installed. However, RD only works on my Computer. I have followed the instructions in several attempts to no avail What is the secret? Should I delete Stremio on the two Onn boxes and start over? Not sure what I would do different.
 
Yesterday on my Nvidia Shield TV pro and Onn box, 1 TV show Gold Rush had no data loaded each time I went to load that show, but all other TV shows worked, Check this morning with my 4k max and all was working, Will check on the other 2 devices today when I get home from work and see if that TV show works on them
Never had this before
 
Ok now all 3 streaming devise showing " No information found about this" message. I will delete and reinstall and see if the TV show reloads. It shows on the main load up screen just when I select it to load the next episode nothing loads
 
So all the files and configuration data are kept in the cloud for Stremio. So you can go over to your buddies place, and if they have Stremio installed, you can log them out of their account(make sure they know the user name and pass ) and then log yourself into their Stremio and all your personal stuff will be applied. All your addons, watch history etc. Then when you leave just log out and they can log back in.
Have fun and STREAM ON!!!
 
Hi,
I installed Stremio about a month ago and everything is working great. Used my PC and then just log into the app on my fire sticks and everything is the same. No longer required to attempt to mirror the devices.
 
At the bottom of the screen which appears for a few seconds, it tells me that the link is no longer good and to get another link. I tried to click on it but it goes nowhere, what do you suggest? All my other apps are working.
 
I have tried everything I know how to do, but still, no sound with Stremio. I have uninstalled twice, tried a different version from their website, uninstalled that and installed from the Google Play Store and still no joy. Stremio support told me to turn on hardware acceleration but I did that have Miki suggested it.
 
I have had Stremio on my Shield Pro for almost 2 years and absolutely no issues with the sound. Not sure what to tell ya. I gave you all the settings I have.
Make sure you do not have Tunnelled Playback enabled in Stremio.
Also try disabling Frame rate matching.
My only last suggestion is to install MX Player Pro or VLC and then try playing a vid using an external player in the Default Player setting. The default player should be set to ExoPlayer to start.
If you have Stremio installed on another Shield and you are logging into the same account on the new install then all settings are saved in the cloud and will be the same, which indicates there is a different setting in the audio config from one shield to another. On the shield I recommended you use the HDMI under Advanced sound settings>Audio Output. Maybe try enabling Auto instead.
 
See we all do things differently. I never miss an update and as part of my daily routine I check for updates and install them immediately. I find most updates actually fix more things than cause further issues and often are security updates which I consider important.
 
I have spent a lot of time trying to get torrentio addon on stremio on my nvidia shield without success although I had no problem on my android phone.i visited stremio website and there reply was that they had suspended torrentio in order to make modifications
 
Since I followed the install anonymously. I wanted to use the Stremio app. But only way is to be a registered user I imagine. Or is there a workaround d to connect the app to my tv app. Using android box btw.
 
This guide illustrates how to use the Stremio-Jackett addon to stream content from debrid providers using Stremio, sourcing content from your **own** torrent indexer (Jackett), rather than relying on the (often-overloaded) torrentio addon!
 
It depends wildly on your indexers. If you've added 20 indexers, Jacket will have to query **each** of them before presenting a result back to Stremio-Jackett. This may take longer than Stremio's addon timeout period, and so you may see no results.
 
"The Elfhosted product alone is great. The team is super transparent on the issues and resolutions that happen as it grows. Lots of opportunity to self-solve issues, but the support from both mods and darth-penguini is SO quick and proactive. Props to them."
 
"I don't understand how there aren't tons of elves already. The way this whole thing is setup is great, from getting a free $10 amount of elfbuckz to start, free 7 day trials on most services, the subscription prices of the products are reasonable, to the smoothness of how everything runs. I just dont get it, people choose to pay way more with places that don't provide the same customer service nor have a great community like this one. I recommend elfhosted to everyone.
 
"Just wanted to check in here and let @Darth-Penguini and anyone/everyone else know...WOW. I have been struggling with storage for years, maintenance of Docker containers, upkeep, all of it. Elfhosted is so freeing. It's an amazing service that I hope to be a member of for a long, long time!"
 
"I just have to say, I am an incredibly satisfied customer. I had been collecting my own content for nearly 20 years. Starting off with just a simple external HD before eventually graduating to a seedbox with 100TB of cloud storage attached and fully automated processes with Sonarr and Radarr . However, the time came when the glory days of unlimited Google Drive storage ended. I thought my days of having my full collection at my fingertips via :plex: were behind me, until I found Real-Debrid and ElfHosted.
